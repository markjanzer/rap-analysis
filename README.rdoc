# Rap Analysis WebApp

## Summary

This app allows people to input a transcription of a rap song (words, rhythm, rhyme, and rhythm of stressed syllables), and have the song displayed in a way that illustrates the musicality of the song. After transcription, the app will supply some statistics about the song, and can do so about artists and albums as a whole.

I created this app part of the way through Dev Bootcamp as a passion project. I used Sinatra as the framework because I did not yet know Rails.

## Moving Forward

Before I move forward with this app, I need to decide what languages and frameworks I am going to use. I am considering using JavaScript frontend such as React (seeing as the main feature of the site is a single page for transcribing songs). I am also considering using Python backend because I would eventually like to incorporate machine learning.

Aside from the intimidating task of choosing new technologies (and recreating the app ground up), my next steps would be to change the way a user inputs a new song to more forgiving and intuitive. Any CSS whatsoever would also be an improvement on the barebones site.

The master branch of this is deployed on Heroku at: http://gentle-wildwood-3897.herokuapp.com
